2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP ALU1/unamedDSP input A B is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP ALU1/unamedDSP__1 input A B is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#3 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP ALU1/unamedDSP__2 input B is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net C1/PCResult_reg[1]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin C1/BranchControlOut_reg_i_2/O, cell C1/BranchControlOut_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ProgramCounter1/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ProgramCounter1/DataMem_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell ProgramCounter1/DataMem_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ProgramCounter1/PCResult_reg[1]_1[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ProgramCounter1/BranchControlIn_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell ProgramCounter1/BranchControlIn_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ProgramCounter1/RegFile_reg_2_211 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ProgramCounter1/RegDst_reg_i_2/O, cell ProgramCounter1/RegDst_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ProgramCounter1/RegFile_reg_2_212 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ProgramCounter1/MemtoReg_reg_i_2/O, cell ProgramCounter1/MemtoReg_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ProgramCounter1/RegFile_reg_2_213 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ProgramCounter1/MemRead_reg_i_2/O, cell ProgramCounter1/MemRead_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#7 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ProgramCounter1/unamedDSP__1_2 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ProgramCounter1/ForceZero_reg_i_2/O, cell ProgramCounter1/ForceZero_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#8 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net ProgramCounter1/unamedDSP__2_0[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin ProgramCounter1/ALUControl_reg[4]_i_2/O, cell ProgramCounter1/ALUControl_reg[4]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
